; PURPOSE:
;
;       This function scales a polygon by the requested amount.

;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       result = ScalePoly(Coordinates,Factor)
;
; RETURN VALUE:
;
;       The function returns the coordinates scaled by the factor amount.
;
;       Coordinates is a [2,n] array of polygon coordinates.  Factor is the value by which
;       the coordinates are scaled.  Factor can be vector to scale the polygon differently in
;       each direction.  Positive values of Factor increase the size of the polygon, while
;       negative values decrease it.
