=Installation Instructions=
==version 2.x.x==
 # If you already have ENVI 4.8 or IDL 8.0 installed, go to Step 2. Otherwise, download and install latest version of [http://www.ittvis.com/ProductsServices/IDL/IDLModules/IDLVirtualMachine.aspx IDL Virtual Machine (VM)].  IDL VM is free, but you will need to register at ITTVis website to download the software. It might take about one business day before your account gets approved by ITTVis, and you are able to download IDL VM. When you install evaluation version of IDL, IDL VM is also installed.      
 # Unzip the LidarTools you have downloaded. Make sure 'resources' folder and 'LidarTools.sav' are in same directory.
 # In Windows, double-clicking 'LidarTools.sav' will start the program. In Unix/Mac, issuing following command in the terminal will start the program.
   <code>idl -vm=Path-to-LidarTools/LidarTools.sav</code>
Replace 'Path-to-LidarTools' with your path, e.g., usr/local/LidarTools/

==version 1.x.x==
  # You will need ENVI 4.7 or above pre-installed in your computer. These tools have not been tested for other versions of ENVI.
  # [http://code.google.com/p/bcal-lidar-tools/downloads/list Download] the Lidar Tools Zip file. Unzip the file in the "save_add" folder of your ENVI installation. On my computer, this folder is located at: "C:\Program Files\ITT\IDL71\products\enviXX\save_add\"
  # Start ENVI
  # BCAL LiDAR tools will be located under a new "BCAL LiDAR" button in the ENVI display between the "Topographic" and "Radar" menus

Note: The tools have been tested to work for ENVI 4.7 and 4.8. If it is not working for your version of ENVI, the best option would be to [http://code.google.com/p/bcal-lidar-tools/source download the source codes], and recompile the program in your machine.
